J. Hruska and I created this tutorial as an introduction to processing of spectroscopic data in Python. It covers everything from loading the data, data exploration and visualization, preprocessing, feature extraction, up to classification. Several techniques are used; PCA, t-SNE, random forest, SVM, MLP. 

It's being used for the DS114 (Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectroscopy â€“ fundamentals, utilization and related techniques) Ph.D. course at [CEITEC PHD SCHOOL](https://amn-phd.ceitec.cz/courseworks/).
