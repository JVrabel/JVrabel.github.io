2-3 guest lectures that cover introduction to Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and ANN applications in physics. The last lecture will be on practical implementation in Python (topics are selected on the go; past years included: backprop. without libraries, object-oriented ANN code from scratch, classifier using Keras, basic data processing pipeline for spectroscopic data, ...)

** Study materials ** 

Lectures are based on the following two publications/courses: 

[A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08823.pdf) (only in Czech)

[Machine Learning for Physicists (by F. Marquardt)](https://pad.gwdg.de/s/Machine_Learning_For_Physicists_2021)
